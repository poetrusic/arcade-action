        <p>Our brand name is called "Arcade Action". We thought of naming our brand "Arcade Action" because it represents the topic of our channel which are gaming videos. "Arcade", also known as a game, is the main content of our Youtube channel. Our videos are all about video games and online gaming. On the other hand, we thought of the second word "Action" because after all, it represents the famous phrase, "Lights, Camera, Action!" which means we are filming or creating a video because we create gaming videos for our youtube channel.</p>
