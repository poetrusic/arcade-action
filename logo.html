    OUR LOGO:
</header>

    <img src="arcaction.jpg" width="300" height="300" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-top: 5px;">

            <h>LOGO ORIGIN</h>

        </header>

        <br>

    <body>
          <p>As shown in the logo, our logo is a tripod since our contents are videos about gaming. A tripod's purpose serves as a stand for filming videos. It also looks like it forms two A's which represents our brand name "Arcade Action".</p>

          <br>

          <p>(see the picture below)</p>

         <br>

         <img src="AA.png" width="300" height="300" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-top: 5px;">
          
         <br>

         <br>

         <P>If you turn our logo sideways, it can also represent a letter E.</P>

         <br>

         <p>(see the picture below)</p>

         <br>

         <img src="E.png" width="300" height="300" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-top: 5px;">

         <br>

         <br>

         <p>As shown in the logo, there are three triangles at the back of the letter E which represent the 3 core values of our brand.</p>

         <br>

    <header>
        3 CORE VALUES
    </header>

    <body>
        <p>The 3 core values represent the highest priorities of our brand which are the following:</p>

        <br>

        <p> a. To Entertain</p>
        <P> b. To Equip</P>
        <p> c. To Enhance</p>

        <br>

        ORIGIN
    </header>

    <body>
        <p> 1. To Entertain. One of the main priorities of our brand is to please the viewers. Most people today need to divert their attention and they do that sometimes by watching Youtube videos like gaming. Gaming is really popular today because you don't just enjoy it, you also learn and get some information from it, which leads us to our next core value, to equip.</p>

        <br>

        <p> 2. To Equip. To equip means to provide, and one of our brand's main priorities is to provide the viewers with knowledge and information on skills, strategies, gaming equipment, and more. Giving them the knowledge they need to develop their abilities will benefit them not only in games but also in real world situations, which brings us to our final core value, to enhance.</p>

        <br>

        <p> 3. To Enhance. The development of people's skills is another one of our top priorities because abilities like these are helpful not only in gaming but also in our daily lives.</p>
